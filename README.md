# HPGLViewer

A web application which views HPGL or PLT files of the CAD world. This application is written in pure javasript with minimal HTML and CSS.
The viewer application has zoom in, zoom out, sliding and pan zoom functionality. There are many desktop applications for the same purpose but to use those apps 
you must install them onto your computer. Without installing anything on your computer, you can view these CAD files with the similar functionality such as zoom in, 
zoom out, sliding and pan zoom. This may be considered as an advantage over desktop apps. This application is developped to be used in a modern web browser 
running on a desktop computer.
